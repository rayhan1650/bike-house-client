    "description": "Honda has launched the Dream Yuga with CBS (Combined Braking System), priced at Rs 54,807 (ex-showroom, Delhi). That's a premium of Rs 560 over the non-CBS variant. Apart from this, the bike remains unchanged. It gets sporty graphics, body-coloured rear view mirrors, rolling resistance tyres and a new color scheme - black with Sunset brown. In terms of design, the Dream Yuga is virtually identical to its elder sibling, the Honda Shine. It features a no-nonsense design with a basic headlight, clear lens indicators, angular tail light, body-coloured grab rail, and an analogue instrument console featuring two round pods. There are no changes on the mechanical front and the 2018 Dream Yuga continues to draw power from a 109.19cc, 4-stroke, air-cooled, BSIV-compliant engine that churns out max power of 8.40PS @ 7500rpm and a peak torque of 8.63Nm @ 5500rpm, mated to a 4-speed gearbox. The latest Dream Yuga is said to be more fuel efficient owing to the Honda Eco Technology (HET) tyres. It is claimed to return a mileage of 72kmpl and has a fuel tank capacity of 8 litres. Braking is handled by 130mm drum brakes at both ends which are attached to 18-inch alloy wheels. Suspension setup includes telescopic forks at the front and a hydraulic shock absorber at the rear.",
