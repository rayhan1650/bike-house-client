        <h2>Q4: What is the purpose of jwt and how does it work?</h2>
        <h4>Answer:</h4>
        <strong className="fs-4">
          <u>Purpose of JWT:</u>
        </strong>
        <p className="fs-5">
          JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security
          information between two parties — a client and a server. This
          information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally
          signed. We use JWT for authorization of user. Once the user is logged
          in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to
          access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that
          token.JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting
          information between parties. Because JWTs can be signed—for example,
          using public/private key pairs—you can be sure the senders are who
          they say they are.
        </p>
        <strong className="fs-4">
          <u>How JWT works:</u>
        </strong>
        <p className="fs-5">
          JSON Web Tokens consist of three parts separated by dots (.), which
          are Header,Payload and Signature. Header contains the type of
          token,The payload contains the claims and The signature is used to
          verify the message wasn't changed along the way. In authentication,
          when the user successfully logs in using their credentials, a JSON Web
          Token will be returned. Since tokens are credentials, great care must
          be taken to prevent security issues. In general, we should not keep
          tokens longer than required. We also should not store sensitive
          session data in browser storage due to lack of security. Whenever the
          user wants to access a protected route or resource, the user agent
          should send the JWT, typically in the Authorization header using the
          Bearer schema.
